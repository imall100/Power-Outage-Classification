    "# Classification of Power Outage Causes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Whenever there is a power outage, one of the big questions is what caused it. Naturally we would like to know the cause of the power outage so we can improve our infustructure or prevent a similar outage from happening. What this model can't be used for, however, is identifying an outage's cause before it is repaired. Although this would be helpful, this can't be done since one of our main explanatory variables is the outage's duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a classification problem since we are trying to classify the type of power outage. We will use a K-nearest neighbor classifier with the target variable being power outage. For the evaluation metric we will use the accuracy score (proportion of predictions being correct). Our goal should be to predict the outage cause correctly as often as possible, so naturally we would use the proportion of outages correctly predicted as our evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "For the baseline model we will use 11 explanatory variables in all. There are two nominal explanatory variables: POSTAL.CODE and CLIMATE.REGION. The rest of the variables are quantitative: OUTAGE.DURATION, TOTAL.CUSTOMERS, MONTH, PC.REALGSP.STATE, UTIL.CONTRI, AREAPCT_URBAN, ANOMOLY.LEVEL, and TOTAL.SALES.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline model has an accuracy rate of 0.5452. At first look this accuracy rate seems low. 46% of the time the model is incorrect? However, we have to assess the model relative to using nothing at all to see if it has any value. Considering the accuracy rate of randomly guessing is only 0.3368 our model presents a valuable improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "For the final model engineer three features. The first is a one-hot encoding of MONTH since it was being treated as quantitative in the baseline model, which doesn't make any sense. The next is a standardized version of ANOMOLY.LEVEL by CLIMATE.REGION. We would expect the anomoly level to vary by climate region, so standardizing it by each region should more accurately identify temperature anomolies. Finally, we see considerable skewness in outage duration. We should be able to get more accurate results if we apply a log transformation to this variable thereby applying less weight to the very high outage durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the same K-nearest neighbor classifier model is used except the number of neighbors is optimized. The optimal number of neighbors of 48 was found using grid search with 5 folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, outage duration outliers are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model had an accuracy rate of about 0.67, meaning it improved upon the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "Finally the model is evaluated for its fairness in prediction between high and low income states. We wouldn't want the model to predict outage cause with different accuracy for high and low income states. Since our response variable is not a binary variable we can't use a parity measure like precision. We will use accuracy rate as the parity measure since it is the most relevant to what we are trying to accomplish and links this fairness evaluation to how we evaluated the performance of the model in the prior portions of this study. A permutation test will be performed\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results of the permutation test, there is not evidence to suggest that the model predicts unfairly between high and low income states."

Month was being treated as a numeric variable in the baseline model when it should probably be treated as categorical. Next, we apply a log transformation to outage duration. In addition, in predicting the cause of a power outage, it would be helpful to know the temperature anomoly level relative to the climate region, rather than in absolute terms. To do this we apply a standard scaler to the anomoly level within climate region groups. Before this can be done a standard scaler by group function is defined:"
